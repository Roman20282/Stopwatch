# Stopwatch
Programm Stopwatch. 
The job of this programm is to simulate a stopwatch. 
It  provide two methods: Start and Stop. We call the start method first,
and the stop method next. Then we ask the stopwatch about the duration between start and stop.
Duration is a value in TimeSpan. 
Programm display the duration on the console. 
We also is able to use a stopwatch multiple times. 
So we may start and stop it and then start and stop it again. 
We can't to start a stopwatch twice in a row (because that may overwrite the initial start time).
